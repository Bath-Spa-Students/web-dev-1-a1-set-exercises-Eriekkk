        <h2>All About AOT</h2>
        <p>Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in 
            fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of 
            hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, 
            resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages 
            to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.
        <br><br>
            After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by 
            enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, 
            his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a 
            way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.</p>

                            <p>Attack on Titan is a modern masterpiece. It’s not just a piece of fiction 
                                which has thrown quality season after season, it’s also one of the very 
                                few anime to have broken into the mainstream, so much so that people who do not watch
                                 anime at all have experienced and loved it. The emergence of the first season of Attack on Titan
                                  drove the series’ popularity to levels rarely seen before in the medium. The long wait before the 
                                  release of season 2 was a major reason (along with certain pacing issues with the manga at the time)
                                 for the dying interest in the series ...</p>

                            <p>Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed 
                                show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the 
                                plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions -
                                 essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want 
                                 to look elsewhere.<br><br>

                                The show is incredibly engaging, and intense because the combat animations are executed perfectly, giving a really personal
                                 front row seat throughout. Not only this but peril is constantly a reinforced aspect ...</p>

                            <p>I started to follow the manga after watching the anime and quite frankly I don't see where and how the plot of Shingeki 
                                no Kyojin can suck, which in my humble opinion is awsome. You can understand the anime very well even without having read 
                                the manga. However, SNK isn't understood by many because it's a psychological manga .. SNK isn't just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and,
                                 of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). 
                                Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can't do it, the ...</p>
